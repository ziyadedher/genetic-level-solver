# Genetic Level Solver
Uses [genetic algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) to evolve creatures that run through a generated level and try to optimize the amount of points they gather.

Built in stock Python with no libraries, this repository was meant as a machine learning exercise.


# Features

  * Simulate an evolutionary system to naturally select the most fit individuals and maximize point aquisition.
  * Visualize the evolutions using a set of highly customizable parameters set through the command line on start.
  * Design your own levels for the simulation to run on using the included level creator.
  * View statistics using `matplotlib`.
  * Plug-in to the program using the 'highly-scalable<sup><sup><sup>ahem</sup></sup></sup> built-in API.


# Dependencies

  * `python >= 3.5`
  * `pygame`
  * `matplotlib` and its dependencies.


# Use
To use this program first make sure you have all the required dependencies, then clone the repository and run the `start.py` file using `python3 start.py`. Instructions will be shown from there on.


# Credits
The basics of this program (release `v1.0`) was created in 8 hours at the University of Toronto St. George campus Local Hack Day hackathon. It placed first.
